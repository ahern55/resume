# My Resume

A repo containing my LaTeX Resume. Based heavily on the template in [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV)

## Building
I use VSCode with [LaTex Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) to build my files as I write them.

## Publishing
I publish my resume to github by running the `publish.sh` script.
